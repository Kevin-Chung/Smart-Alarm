# Smart-Alarm

An alarm clock that intelligently alters itself to make sure you get to where you need to be on time. 
Smart Alarm will  take into account weather and traffic data, and your own habbits and analyze the data. It will then take this data and update itself and adjust what time it goes off in order to give you the best opportunity to never be late!
